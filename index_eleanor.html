					<h1>The Burberry Revolution</h1>
					<p>A decade ago fashion house Burberry&#39;s condition was dire, but then CEO Angela Arendts and creative director Christopher Bailey turned the company around. They made Burberry an admired name in fashion, branching into China and onto the internet with equal skill. &#182; And that&#39;s probably why Apple poached Arendts last year to help build out its already formidable retail capabilities. But apparently Burberry wanted continuity, because the company appointed Bailey its new CEO&#8211;an unusual track for creative directors. Here, Bailey talks about the difference between design thinkers and managers (the distance between the two isn&#39;t as great as you&#39;d think) and how to turn trench coats into emotion&#8211;packed stories.&#8211;Scott Dadich</p>

					WIRED: For me, transitioning from creative director to the boss meant juggling a vastly more complicated set of decisions. How has it been for you?
					Bailey: It’s been remarkably smooth. Angela and I always worked as a partnership, part of a bigger team, and the team is still there. And I’ve always moved from one project to another, whether it be an architecture project, a technology project, a music project, a design project. My new role, it‘s just a broader audience. I’m talking to communities I wouldn’t have traditionally spent as much time with—investors, analysts. I took on this role because design and creativity is the soul of what makes Burberry tick, so that’s the way that I’m approaching my new role, as well as the way that I did my previous one.
					Do you find your vision of that design has changed?
					You know, I never had some grand aspiration or some great plan to take on this role. But I think it was a very natural, organic evolution, because we place design thinking at the heart of what we do. We’ve always worked like that. You either have the world as your canvas, or you have a one-inch-by-one-inch screen. The important thing, regardless of scale or format, is it creating an emotional reaction. Even if you have a tiny screen, you have sound. And sound gives you a whole other kind of world to play in. That’s how you connect emotionally.
					You’re talking about music?
					Yeah. With music, you can very quickly create emotion. All of us I think react to the power of sound. It can be exciting, it can be romantic, there can be a melancholic spirit if you play something, there can be something that drives you kind of crazy and you kind of get your adrenaline going.
					But now people aren’t just experiencing the story you’re trying to tell. Social media means they’re reacting to it.
					I love that dialogue. We grew from a retail organization, where you can have a one-on-one conversation with a customer. Now we’ve got all these other platforms to be able to do that again. And when you start to filter everything, you start to see trends that we can then use to develop products. 
					There’s signal for you inside the noise of social media?
					We use our website (((chk))) Art of the Trench in the design studio all the time as a source of inspiration. We send something out into the world—this little trench coat—and it gets translated zillions of different ways all around the world. Then it comes back to us. Or somebody might literally type “wish you would do this kind of a coat.” 
					How would you characterize your personal design philosophy?
					My father was a carpenter, and I’ve always had an intrinsic kind of love for making things. My grandfather was an electrician and a crazy gadget person. As soon as some new thing came out and he would buy it. That kind of shaped the way that I see the world. But I also I love things that take time. The making of a trench coat is a very, very slow process because there’s a real craft; there’s a lot of hand sewing, there’s a lot of different processes. The weaving is extraordinarily complex. That’s how I see the world—quick-quick, slow-slow, and I admire that approach to design. Because not everything should be quick and not everything should be slow.
					Do you find that new technology privileges the quick over the slow?
					No, I don’t see it as a problem. A couple of years ago we livestreamed a runway show. Historically, a fashion show was been about the industry, press, and buyers. As soon as you open it up to livestream, you now have a global audience. But it takes four to six months to get clothes into a store. So we developed this thing called Made to Order, where if you watched the show and wanted to buy something, we’d make it for you in six to eight weeks. Now, it is a nightmare, because it changes your whole supply chain, it changes the whole way that you weave, and you have to make a lot of commitments up front. It meant we had to recreate our process. But that change is good.
					The movement of some of the tech giants moving into wearables suggests a convergence coming between luxury, fashion, and technology. Do you see a role there for Burberry?
					Apple is successful because the design of that product is incredibly beautiful. When you say, “actually, now not only is that product going to be in your pocket or in your bag, but you’re going to wear it,” that changes the whole thing, because suddenly it’s on show. Anything that you wear tells people something about your character. But it’s not just on a device. What happens if you put technology into fibers? What happens if you put chips into an accessory? We’ve set up a whole group to think about this kind of thing. We call it the What If Group.
					But a person might have a lifelong relationship with a trench coat. The technology lifecycle shortens every day. How do you reconcile that?
					I love that some things will be there forever, but I like when those two worlds come together. People will always want a physical experience, and the physical experiences create the stories to tell digitally. It’s not a clear-cut division between the physical and the digital worlds. The interesting thing is when they merge and come together.
